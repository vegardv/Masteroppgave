\chapter*{Preface}
This project is written as a part of my MSc degree at the Department of Engineering Cybernetics at NTNU  and is part of research conducted by the Center of Autonomous Marine Operations and Systems (AMOS). The work in this project will be continued into my master thesis.\\
\newline
The execution of this project would not have been possible without the financial backing from AMOS and the usage of equipment at the electronics and mechanical workshops at the Department of Engineering Cybernetics, NTNU. I will like to thank the guys at these workshops for valuable help and guidance.\\
\newline
I would also like to thank my supervisors Professor Tor Arne Johansen and PhD Candidate Kristian Klausen for guidance and encouragement along the way.\\
